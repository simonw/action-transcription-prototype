00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.720
If a company is mining something,
there are usually byproducts,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.280
the stuff that's left behind after
extraction and processing.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.240
And these days, the mining company should
be required to deal with those byproducts,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.720
but in the past they often
just piled them up

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.640
and assumed someone would deal
with the problem

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.080
at some point in the future.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.640
If those byproducts are toxic,
that’s a problem.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.600
But here in Hirschau, in Germany,
it's a bit different.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.000
Just over there is an
open-pit kaolin mine:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.280
kaolin is a really common mineral

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.960
that's used in the manufacture
of a lot of things,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.200
everything from pottery to toothpaste.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.240
And there is a big pile of
mining byproduct here.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.040
I'm standing on it,
it is 120 metres high.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.000
But it's just sand.
Regular sand. Made of quartz,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.440
like what you'd find in the desert.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.280
Quartz sand can be useful in industry.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.680
These days the sand that the mines
produce here is sold off.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.000
But for decades there was
too much of it,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.680
so as it was pretty harmless,
the mining companies just piled it up.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.880
What do you do with 35 million tons of sand,
in a pile that's dominating the landscape?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.080
The answer, of course, is
make it a tourist attraction.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.000
Welcome to the ski resort and
amusement park of Mount Kaolino.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
I should point out — it’s 9am on
a weekday as I’m filming this,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.720
so there aren’t many people around,
it's not fully open.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.320
In the summer school holidays,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.680
this place is as busy as a
regular ski slope would be in high season.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.704
IN GERMAN:
 
 
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.400
A lot of this hill is covered in
trees and other vegetation,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.840
and they will help anchor the sand
and keep everything in place.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.040
So I had to ask:

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.440
surely all the people
descending this mountain

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.600
keep dragging the sand down with them?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.920
I'm sure that the local government
could have insisted

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040
that this hill be cleaned up and
the sand disposed of somehow.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.200
But why would they? Now, Hirschau
isn't just a mining town.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.600
It's a mining town with a
local theme park.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.680
Tourists have a reason to come here,
and spend money.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.360
There are more jobs for the locals.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.360
And every so often, someone will come along
and tell the world that, hey,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.640
there's a ski slope made of sand in Germany.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.240
No, I...

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.880
I can't sandboard, I would die.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.480
This is not the hill to learn on!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.200
I'm going to take the little cable car down.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.320
How do I... I'm genuinely terrified I'm
going to slip off this!

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.200
How do I get out of this?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.840
That tightened it!
Oh my god, okay.
