<p begin="00:00:00.080" end="00:00:00.913" style="s2">Hi everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:00:00.920" end="00:00:04.220" style="s2">I&#39;m Simon Willison and I&#39;ve spent the<br />last four years building tools for data</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.540" end="00:00:08.100" style="s2">analysis and exploration on top of sqlite.<br />I&#39;m going to give you a tour of them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.590" end="00:00:09.460" style="s2">Let&#39;s start with some data.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.800" end="00:00:13.340" style="s2">The Florida fish and wildlife conservation<br />commission released a data set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.341" end="00:00:17.620" style="s2">Manatee carcass recovery locations in<br />Florida dating all the way back to 1974.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.960" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">And they make that data<br />available as a CSV file. Here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.751" end="00:00:23.584" style="s2">that CSV file.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.010" end="00:00:26.790" style="s2">I&#39;m going to import that into a sqlite<br />database using a tool I wrote called</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.410" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">sqlite-utils. So I type<br />sqlite-utils insert. I&#39;ll<br />call the database manatees.db.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.659" end="00:00:36.810" style="s2">Table called locations. And<br />in goes that CSV file. Oh,</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.811" end="00:00:37.644" style="s2">it wants me to add dash csv.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.060" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">So I do that and now I have a file<br />called manatees.db. It&#39;s 2.8 megabytes.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.350" end="00:00:47.630" style="s2">Now I can do things like<br />I can ask for its schema.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.060" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">It&#39;s got a table called locations<br />with a bunch of columns in.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.790" end="00:00:52.470" style="s2">I can also run some queries against it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.479" end="00:00:56.310" style="s2">Let&#39;s do select county comma repdate</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.630" end="00:01:01.330" style="s2">from locations, limit 10. There<br />we go. And that comes out as JSON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.331" end="00:01:03.170" style="s2">If I add dash T I get that as a table.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.170" end="00:01:07.319" style="s2">I can even add fancy formats and say<br />things like dash fmt latex to get out a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.910" end="00:01:11.480" style="s2">latex representation of that ready for<br />me to paste into my academic paper.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.770" end="00:01:13.120" style="s2">Let&#39;s do something a bit more visual.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:17.240" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to launch my data set<br />tool against that sqlite database.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">So this is now running a local web<br />server. And if I click on here,</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.160" style="s2">I get a web interface and I can<br />start browsing through that table.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.490" end="00:01:25.030" style="s2">Looks like a table of data,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.610" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">but one of my favorite ways of exploring<br />a dataset that I&#39;m used to is using</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.311" end="00:01:31.310" style="s2">something called faceting.<br />So here&#39;s the dataset.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.510" end="00:01:34.230" style="s2">It&#39;s suggesting that the interesting<br />facets here might be the month, the sex,</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.231" end="00:01:36.670" style="s2">the dcode, or the mortality.<br />Let&#39;s click on mortality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.209" end="00:01:41.030" style="s2">So now this is showing me for these<br />13 and a half thousand sadly deceased</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.030" end="00:01:43.750" style="s2">manatees what were the most common<br />causes of mortality for them?</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.870" end="00:01:46.819" style="s2">So unsurprisingly, it was watercraft<br />collisions was a good fifth of them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.819" end="00:01:51.220" style="s2">Natural cold stress. Human<br />related floodgate and canal<br />lock is the least common,</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.400" end="00:01:53.060" style="s2">but it looks interesting so<br />I can click through that.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.400" end="00:01:54.900" style="s2">Now it&#39;s suggesting<br />that I facet by county.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.540" end="00:01:59.060" style="s2">I can see that Miami-Dade county is the<br />most dangerous county to be if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.061" end="00:02:02.140" style="s2">manatee and you&#39;re worried about getting<br />trapped in a floodgate or canal lock.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">So we&#39;re already beginning to learn<br />things about this data just through firing</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.731" end="00:02:07.730" style="s2">it up in datasette and<br />starting to apply facets.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.900" end="00:02:10.570" style="s2">Everything you can see in datasette,<br />you can export back out again.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.639" end="00:02:14.490" style="s2">Here we&#39;ve got 254 rows where<br />mortality was that canal lock.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">And if we click on CSV, we can get back<br />just that subset of the data as CSV.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.850" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">I can click on JSON to get it as JSON,</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.371" end="00:02:22.889" style="s2">which is ready to be imported into<br />other programming environments.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.110" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">But I can also click view and edit SQL<br />and see the actual SQL query that was run</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.660" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">to produce those results. And I can edit<br />it too. I&#39;m gonna say, you know what,</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.400" end="00:02:36.240" style="s2">I just want the tlength, state county,<br />these columns here for those rows.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.419" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">And if I hit run SQL then I&#39;ll get back<br />that subset of the data. And again,</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:43.600" style="s2">I can support that out as CSV, and<br />I can get that back as JSON. Now,</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:44.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re thinking, hang on,</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.961" end="00:02:48.630" style="s2">does this mean that I construct a SQL<br />query in my own client side JavaScript and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.631" end="00:02:52.150" style="s2">then run it against the server via this<br />URL here? The answer is yes, you can.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.210" end="00:02:54.710" style="s2">And it&#39;s not actually nearly<br />as bad idea as it sounds.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.940" end="00:02:57.710" style="s2">This might look like a SQL injection<br />vulnerability as a feature,</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.510" end="00:03:01.720" style="s2">and indeed it is, but it&#39;s completely<br />safe for a couple of reasons. Firstly,</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.780" end="00:03:04.120" style="s2">the database file itself is<br />opened in read-only mode.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:07.000" style="s2">So there is nothing that you can do<br />here that would modify that data as it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.001" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">stored on disc. And secondly,</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.500" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">all of these SQL queries have a hard<br />time limit of a second applied to them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.919" end="00:03:13.960" style="s2">If the query takes longer than<br />that it terminates with an error.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">But let&#39;s clean this data up a little bit.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.261" end="00:03:18.419" style="s2">This table isn&#39;t necessarily<br />in the best possible state.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.070" end="00:03:21.330" style="s2">For that I&#39;m gonna switch<br />back to sqlite-utils again.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.830" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">So sqlite-utils has a number of<br />tools designed for cleaning data.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.510" end="00:03:27.970" style="s2">The first is a command called<br />sqlite-utils transform,</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.250" end="00:03:30.610" style="s2">which you can think of as basically<br />a superpowered alter statement.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.130" end="00:03:32.889" style="s2">So here what I&#39;m gonna do is<br />I&#39;m gonna rename some columns.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.890" end="00:03:34.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve renamed lat to<br />latitude long to longitude.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.080" end="00:03:36.930" style="s2">I&#39;ll change the type<br />of that tlength column,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.931" end="00:03:38.810" style="s2">which is the measured<br />length of the manatee.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.880" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">I&#39;ll change that to a float<br />from the text that is now.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.590" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">I&#39;ll drop a few columns that I know<br />aren&#39;t particularly interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.180" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">And I&#39;ll reassign the primary key of<br />that column to be the fieldid column.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:49.500" style="s2">So I&#39;m gonna paste this into my terminal</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.500" end="00:03:53.640" style="s2">and start datasette running again.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:57.220" style="s2">And now when I refresh this page you<br />can see that we&#39;ve cleaned up the data</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.221" end="00:03:59.140" style="s2">quite a lot. We&#39;ve got a<br />small number of columns.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.270" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">We&#39;ve renamed latitude and<br />longitude. We&#39;ve got that new key.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.030" end="00:04:03.650" style="s2">So this is already beginning<br />to look quite a bit better.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.820" end="00:04:06.490" style="s2">Let&#39;s do something about those dates.<br />That&#39;s not my ideal date format.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:08.530" style="s2">I like them to be ISO<br />formatted. And for this,</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.531" end="00:04:11.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to use another sqlite-utils<br />command - sqlite-utils convert.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:15.090" style="s2">What this does is it lets you select one<br />or more columns and then run a Python</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.650" end="00:04:17.330" style="s2">function against those<br />columns. In this case,</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.470" end="00:04:19.170" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use a built-in<br />recipe called r.parsedatetime to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">transform those columns. So I run that,</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:27.390" style="s2">it churns away and it applies that<br />function to all 13,000 rows in the data.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.529" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">And now when I start datasette back up<br />again you can see that those dates have</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.271" end="00:04:35.510" style="s2">been converted and are now in that ISO<br />format that&#39;s somewhat easier to work</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.511" end="00:04:37.450" style="s2">with. Let&#39;s do one last thing here.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:41.160" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna facet my dcode and then<br />I&#39;m gonna facet by mortality.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.010" end="00:04:44.339" style="s2">And you&#39;ll notice that these<br />numbers are suspiciously similar.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:47.779" style="s2">It looks like dcode 1 corresponds with<br />human related watercraft collision.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:50.820" style="s2">All of these dcodes are actually just<br />numeric codes for these mortalities.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:54.580" style="s2">So let&#39;s clean the data up further by<br />extracting those out into a separate</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.581" end="00:04:58.060" style="s2">table. I&#39;m going to extract these two<br />columns from that locations table.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:01.540" style="s2">I&#39;m going to rename mortality to name in<br />the resulting table and that resulting</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.541" end="00:05:06.430" style="s2">table&#39;s going to be called mortality,<br />like that. So I paste that in here.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.339" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">And now if I hit refresh on this table,</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.950" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s given me an error because I&#39;m trying<br />to facet by a decode column that no</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.681" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">longer exists. But here we go.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.180" end="00:05:18.600" style="s2">So now we have a new column called<br />mortalityid and you&#39;ll notice that these</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.601" end="00:05:21.080" style="s2">right here are hyperlinks through<br />to a record in another table.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.560" end="00:05:23.000" style="s2">I can go up to that table<br />and see here they are,</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.001" end="00:05:25.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve got their decodes and they&#39;ve<br />got their names and datasette is smart</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.721" end="00:05:29.670" style="s2">enough to spot when a foreign key table<br />has a column called name and it will use</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.671" end="00:05:32.110" style="s2">that as the label on the hyperlink.<br />That works for faceting too.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.730" end="00:05:34.589" style="s2">So this latitude and<br />longitude column looks fun.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.680" end="00:05:36.150" style="s2">Let&#39;s do something interesting with that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.420" end="00:05:39.830" style="s2">Datasette support plug-ins and if you<br />go to the datasette website and look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.831" end="00:05:40.191" style="s2">the plug-ins</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.191" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">[inaudible], you&#39;ll see a list of<br />81 plug-ins that have been released<br />for datasette so far. I can search</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">for map and see there are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">few options for mapping plugins.<br />This one here, datasette-cluster-map<br />looks like it might be what we want.<br />So I&#39;m going to run datasette install<br />dataset-cluster-map. And this goes ahead<br />and installs that plugin. And now when<br />I run datasette again, the plugin has<br />now kicked in. The plugin looks for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">latitude and longitude columns.<br />If it finds them it plots their</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:40.270" style="s2">data on a map. I can actually<br />load all 13 and a half</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:41.103" style="s2">thousand points and start seeing a pretty<br />good indication of where it&#39;s dangerous<br />to be a manatee just through clicking<br />through and browsing that map on its own.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.029" end="00:06:14.930" style="s2">And this also works with the facets.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.931" end="00:06:17.089" style="s2">So if I click through to the human<br />related floodgate and canal lock,</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.040" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">I can see a map of just those incidents<br />that featured that cause of mortality.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.860" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">So we&#39;re doing pretty well.<br />We started with a CSV file.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.290" end="00:06:27.320" style="s2">We&#39;ve turned it into a much cleaner<br />database structure and now we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.321" end="00:06:30.120" style="s2">visualization too. Let&#39;s share<br />this with the rest of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.600" end="00:06:33.320" style="s2">And I&#39;m going to deploy this<br />using a serverless hosting<br />program called cloud run</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.420" end="00:06:34.253" style="s2">by Google cloud.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.700" end="00:06:38.350" style="s2">And cloud run provides a very inexpensive<br />way to run stateless web applications</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:40.230" style="s2">online. The word stateless<br />is very important.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.550" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">Normally you&#39;d expect a database<br />application to be full of state,</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.170" end="00:06:46.470" style="s2">but it turns out if your database is<br />read-only, if it&#39;s a sqlite database file,</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.610" end="00:06:49.670" style="s2">you can literally package it up as part<br />of that docker container and deploy it</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.830" end="00:06:51.029" style="s2">directly to a serverless hosting provider.</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.570" end="00:06:53.029" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to run<br />datasette publish cloudrun,</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.630" end="00:06:54.670" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna call the service manatees.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.070" end="00:06:57.470" style="s2">I&#39;m passing a little bit of metadata and<br />I&#39;m gonna tell it to install a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.589" end="00:06:59.500" style="s2">of plugins as well, that<br />cluster mapp plugin,</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.501" end="00:07:01.220" style="s2">but also the datasette GraphQL one.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.390" end="00:07:06.710" style="s2">So I paste that in here and it&#39;s going<br />to package everything up into a docker</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.711" end="00:07:08.910" style="s2">container, push that docker<br />container up to Google cloud,</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.911" end="00:07:12.190" style="s2">then build the container and they&#39;ll<br />then deploy it and assign a URL.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.590" end="00:07:14.870" style="s2">And that normally takes<br />about 60 to 70 seconds.</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.830" end="00:07:17.210" style="s2">At the end of that it gives me a URL.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.850" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">I can pop that open and here is how<br />our brand new manatees database with</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.801" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">that extra metadata. Click<br />through to locations.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:26.760" style="s2">And I can see those locations on that map.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.540" end="00:07:29.400" style="s2">And remember we installed<br />that GraphQL plugin.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.560" end="00:07:33.640" style="s2">I can actually click on this cog here<br />and access a GraphQL API for those</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.880" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">locations. This even goes as far as<br />expanding those foreign key relationships,</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.740" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">in this case the mortality one,</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.100" end="00:07:41.550" style="s2">and nesting those together as<br />part of that GraphQL query.</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.420" end="00:07:46.320" style="s2">So we now have a full blown GraphQL<br />API for the manatee carcass locations,</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.460" end="00:07:50.480" style="s2">in addition to the JSON API and the<br />visual interface for exploring that data.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.340" end="00:07:54.440" style="s2">So hopefully that gives you a good<br />idea of the kind of tooling I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:55.320" style="s2">building here.</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.320" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">I mentioned plugins earlier - as you saw<br />datasette has over 80 plugins driving</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.220" end="00:08:01.830" style="s2">all kinds of additional<br />functionality through authentication,</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.831" end="00:08:03.110" style="s2">different ways of visualizing things,</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.400" end="00:08:06.670" style="s2">geospatial plugins that can do more<br />complex things with geospatial data.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.630" end="00:08:09.090" style="s2">But the other side of<br />the datasette project,</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.100" end="00:08:12.250" style="s2">these tools for creating<br />these sqlite database files,</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.770" end="00:08:14.170" style="s2">I showed you sqlite-utils already.</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.650" end="00:08:18.450" style="s2">I also have a whole family of tools for<br />converting other formats and APIs into</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.510" end="00:08:20.290" style="s2">sqlite. I&#39;ve got GitHub to sqlite,</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.291" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">which pulls down your data from github<br />about issues and issue comments and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.361" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">commits. Twitter sqlite does the<br />same thing with your Twitter data.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.950" end="00:08:31.410" style="s2">And the goal here is I&#39;m trying to<br />increase that range of things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.411" end="00:08:34.370" style="s2">represented as sqlite, partly so<br />that you can use them with datasette.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.390" end="00:08:37.809" style="s2">But also because I think sqlite is a<br />fantastic sort of interoperable standard</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.910" end="00:08:40.290" style="s2">for archiving and sharing<br />data just on its own.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.510" end="00:08:43.240" style="s2">The last trick I&#39;ll show<br />you with datasette is that<br />you can also use it to build</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.280" end="00:08:46.360" style="s2">websites. In fact, datasette.io,<br />the official website,</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.460" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">is itself running on datasette. Datasette<br />allows you to set up custom templates.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.161" end="00:08:51.559" style="s2">So I have a custom<br />template for the homepage.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.260" end="00:08:54.990" style="s2">It&#39;s got a database table here full of<br />news, which is shown on the homepage.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.220" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">The entire thing is built out<br />of this GitHub repository.</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.390" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">Something I&#39;ve been exploring a lot<br />recently isvthis idea of using GitHub</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.041" end="00:09:03.400" style="s2">actions to automate data<br />processing and publishing.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">So every time I push a commit to the<br />datasette.io repository a script runs that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.340" end="00:09:11.520" style="s2">builds all of these sqlite databases<br />and then deploys them using datasette</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.521" end="00:09:14.280" style="s2">publish directly from this,<br />GitHub actions workflow.</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.900" end="00:09:17.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve been calling this the baked<br />data architectural pattern.</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.650" end="00:09:21.070" style="s2">The key idea here is that for websites<br />that don&#39;t change particularly often,</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.071" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">content-oriented websites,</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.290" end="00:09:25.309" style="s2">you can bake a read-only copy of<br />your data alongside the code of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.309" end="00:09:28.190" style="s2">application and you can deploy them as<br />a single unit. As I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.670" end="00:09:31.190" style="s2">serverless hosting providers like cloud<br />run make this incredibly inexpensive,</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.260" end="00:09:34.190" style="s2">extremely robust and these scale<br />amazingly well because as you accept more</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.191" end="00:09:37.340" style="s2">traffic you just spin up more instances.<br />So I hope I&#39;ve piqued your interest.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.100" style="s2">If you want to learn more, please<br />hit the datasette.io website.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.120" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">If you want to talk to me<br />about this stuff in person,</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.020" end="00:09:45.780" style="s2">I run an office hour sessions on a Friday<br />where you&#39;re welcome to book a slot</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.781" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">and we can have a conversation about<br />what you can do with datasette,</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.221" end="00:09:50.420" style="s2">but also things you might want<br />to do that aren&#39;t possible yet.</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.421" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">Because I&#39;m always looking for ways to<br />expand out and improve the software.</p>
